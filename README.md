  <strong>Lucia Auth v1.8</strong> : : 
  <a href="https://sprightly-pavlova-2c5afc.netlify.app/">Live Preview</a>
</summary>

<br>

\*\* Midway through building this app, Lucia had been updated from v1.8 to v2 which brought with it massive breaking changes and, more regrettably, the loss of all v1.8 documentation that I was using as reference. Maybe later I will consider redoing everything using Lucia v2

## Setup

1. Install all packages. `pnpm -r i`
2. Create a .env file with your database connection variables.
   - Look at `apps/with-lucia-v1.8/.env.example`
3. Push the schema defintions to planetscale. `pnpm --filter with-lucia-v1.8 drizzle:push`
4. Run the app. `pnpm --filter with-lucia-v1.8 dev`

<summary><strong>Local MySQL Image</strong></summary>

<br>

If you don't want to use planetscale and would rather use a local MySQL docker image make sure you do the following things

1. Install the mysql2 driver `pnpm --filter with-lucia-v1.8 i mysql2`
2. Update the database config to use the mysql2 driver in `$lib/server/db.ts`
3. Update the lucia config to use the new database config in `$lib/server/auth.ts`
4. Update the schemas to add back foreign keys since planetscale doesn't use them
5. Start the docker container with the mysql2 image. `docker-compose up -d`
6. Update the .env file with your database variables.
7. Push your schemas up to the database. `pnpm --filter with-lucia-v1.8 drizzle:push`
8. Run the app. `pnpm --filter with-lucia-v1.8 dev`
